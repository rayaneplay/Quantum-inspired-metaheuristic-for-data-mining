Master's Thesis: Quantum-Inspired Discrete-Elephant Herding Optimization Algorithm for Data Clustering

This repository is for my master's thesis project, focusing on the development and implementation of a novel optimization algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and elephant herding behavior. This algorithm aims to solve clustering problems efficiently and effectively, offering a unique approach to optimizing data clustering tasks.
